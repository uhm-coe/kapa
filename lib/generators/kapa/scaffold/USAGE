    views. The resource is ready to use as a starting point for a RESTful,
    resource-oriented application for your KAPA project.

    For example, 'scaffold kapa/note title body:text' gives
    you a model with those three attributes, a controller that handles
    the create/show/update/destroy, forms to create and edit your note, and
